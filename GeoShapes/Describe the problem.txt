– Circle, Rectangle & Triangle classes that inherit from
Geoshape. Each of them has its own constructors,
setters & getters and calcArea methods.
– Main class that consists of
• sumArea( ) method that returns the sum of areas of any 3
shapes.
• main( ) method in which you will create the objects and pass
them to the sumArea( ) to get their sum of areas and print it.
